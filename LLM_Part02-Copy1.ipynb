      "As on a pillory, looking through the lute;\r\n",
      "While she did call me rascal fiddler\r\n",

      "As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:\r\n",
      "Say she be mute and will not speak a word;\r\n",

      "If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,\r\n",
      "As though she bid me stay by her a week:\r\n",
      "If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day\r\n",
      "When I shall ask the banns and when be married.\r\n",
